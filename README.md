# eyeDoubleMatch

Double Match is a game of Solitaire that I played a long time ago. I honestly do not remember how I learned it, but I liked it better than the normal Klondike game, simply because it does not take that long to either win or lose.

In the game, you deal 8 cards on to the table. Now in those 8 cards you look to see any pairs that are in the piles. When you see a pair, you then deal a card from the deck to cover both the cards that make up the pair. You continue this till either 

1. You run out of cards in the deck; meaning you WIN, or 

2. You still have cards in the deck, but there are no pairs are displayed in the pile of 8. In that case you lose.

I hope you enjoy this game as much as I did a long time ago !

Now with Game Center included, compete against other players !
